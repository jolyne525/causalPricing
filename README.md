## Project Overview

**Causal Pricing** is a simulation platform designed to demonstrate the pitfalls of traditional statistical methods in pricing strategies and the power of **Causal Inference**.

In real-world e-commerce, raw data often contains **Confounding Biases** (e.g., loyal members pay higher prices but also buy more due to high income). A naive analysis might incorrectly conclude that "higher prices lead to higher sales" (Simpson's Paradox).

This project uses **Machine Learning (Random Forest)** to control for confounders, uncover the **True Price Elasticity**, and simulate the revenue uplift generated by rational, causal-driven pricing decisions.

> **Key Concept**: Moving from *Correlation* ("People who pay more buy more") to *Causation* ("If we raise the price, sales will actually drop").

## Key Features

- **Synthetic Data Generator**: Simulates a complex retail environment with hidden confounders ($Income \rightarrow Price$ and $Income \rightarrow Sales$).
- **Comparative Analysis**:
  - **Naive Model (OLS)**: Represents traditional analytics that fall into the correlation trap.
  - **Causal Model (ML)**: Uses Random Forest to adjust for covariates and estimate the true treatment effect.
- **Elasticity Estimation**: Calculates the true price elasticity ($E_d \approx -0.5$) using intervention logic.
- **Business Impact Simulator**: Quantifies the financial loss of wrong pricing and the **Revenue Uplift** from causal-based pricing.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Streamlit
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)
- **Visualization**: Plotly Express & Graph Objects

## Methodology: The Causal Graph

The system tackles the following causal structure:

1. **The Confounder ($Z$)**: `Income` & `Membership Status`.
   - High income users are more likely to be members.
   - Members are often offered higher prices (Price Discrimination) but have higher baseline demand.
2. **The Treatment ($T$)**: `Price`.
3. **The Outcome ($Y$)**: `Sales`.

**The Challenge**: $Corr(Price, Sales) > 0$ due to $Z$, even though the true causal effect $Price \rightarrow Sales$ is negative.

**The Solution**: We estimate $E[Y|T, Z]$ using Random Forest to isolate the effect of $T$ on $Y$.
